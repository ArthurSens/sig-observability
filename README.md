# CNCF SIG Observability üî≠‚öôÔ∏è

Special Interest Group for Observability under the umbrella of [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).

## Mission Statement

The SIG Observability focuses on topics pertaining to the observation of cloud native workloads. Additionally, it produces
supporting material and best practices for end-users and provides guidance and coordination for CNCF projects working within the SIG‚Äôs scope.

### What is in the Scope?

* Foster, review and grow the ecosystem of observability related projects, users, and maintainers in the open source, cloud-native scope.
* Identify and report gaps in the CNCF's project portfolio on topics of observability to the TOC and the wider CNCF community.
* Collect, curate, champion, and disseminate patterns and current best practices related to the observation of cloud-native systems that are effective and actionable. 
Educate and inform users with unbiased, accurate, and pertinent information. Educate and help other CNCF projects in regarding observability techniques and practices available within the CNCF.
* Provide and maintain a vendor-neutral venue for relevant thought validation, discussion, and project feedback.
* Provide a ladder for community members to become involved with the technical oversight of projects within the SIG's scope in an open, transparent, and inclusive way.
